NEGF_ALAMDE
====

# Overview

* mod_dymat.py is a python module for generating dynamical matrix by using hessian file in ALAMODE. 

* NEGF(-mulp).py is a script to calculate k-resolved phonon transmission function by using NEGF method. This script needs to be combined with mod_dymat.py.

* tran.py is a script to calculate transmission function averaged in 1st Brillouin zone from the data obtained by NEGF.py.

* kappa.py is a script to calculate phonon thermal ocnductance from transmission function data.
